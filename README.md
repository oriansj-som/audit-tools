Tools for running an audit

The Audit process is simple
1) You update the Agency Mapping Document (this covers name changes, agency splits/mergers)
2) You fill out the agency control matrix
3) You generate the audit control assignments
4) You generate the questionaires to be sent to the auditors/agencies
5) The various agencies work with their assigned auditors to answer/address/test their controls
6) You import the resulting questionaire results
7) You output the Final report which CMS/IRS/PCI DSS expects to see
8) Congrats your scary audits just became a cake walk.

The documentation folder contains example CMS controls including the latest ARC-AMPE and how those controls map back to prior CMS Controls
